# PYTHON SCRIPT FOR FETCHING TEAM ICONS

run the following commands in order:


1. install dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. run the script
    - inside `index.py`, there is a variable `teams`. fill this with the team name abbreviations (eg. CLG, TSM) of team icons you want. THey will be stored in the `icons` folder
    - note that this script only works for teams that have not disbanded (maybe we can edit this later)
```
python3 index.py
```
